# Raspberry-Pi
this is for my specific setup with led lights in 17, 5, 13 on the GPIO
this creates a specific order in which the lights light up and turn off in a specific order
note this is an improved upon copy of something I worked on a short while ago and this specific version is not tested
ENJOY!!!!
